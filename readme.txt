WooCommerce Product Request

== Description ==

WooCommerce Product Request – a quick order module or a “One Click Buy” module. It can significantly simplify the process of ordering products in your store that works on the WooCommerce engine.
The module significantly simplifies the ordering process, as it’s enough to fill a minimal amount of fields right on the product page without going to the cart.
All product requests are displayed in the admin panel of the site `wp-admin -> Product Requests`, as well as the plugin sends a duplicate message to the administrator by e-mail.
In general, the plugin creates an application for the product, but does not reserve the goods in the warehouse. Therefore, it is important to quickly process applications and convert them into real orders.
